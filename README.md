# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project helps to improve access to ride sharing ability and determine affordability for the city types. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, ride sharing data is summarized by city type and create multiple-line graph visualization that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Data source : Resources/city_data.csv, Resources/ride_data.csv
- Software : Pandas, Jupyter notebook , Matplotlib
- Results : Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png

### Total Fares - Rural vs Suburban v Urban
- Since Urban has more number of rides, it tops the Fares table with #39,854.38 , suburban in second with $19,356.33 and rural in the last with $4,327.93.

### Average Fare per ride - Rural vs Suburban v Urban
- Rural tops this average fare per ride table with $34.62 because of total rides vs total drivers ratio. Suburban comes in second with $30.97 and Urban in the last with $24.53 because of more drivers.

As shown in above picture, rural weekly fares stays below $500, suburban stays in $1000 - $1500 range and Urban has high weekly earnings from $2000 - $2500.


## Summary

Following bar chart shows driver vs rides insight for each city type. Based on above analysis here are some of the business recommendations:

- Average fare per ride and average fare per driver is more in Rural. To bring down the numbers and distribute the data better, we should either increase the rides or decrease the number of drivers.
- Average fare per ride is more in suburban city, increasing the rides will help riders get good deal on their rides.
- Average fare per driver is very less for Urban city. Decreasing the driver count will result in better pay for drivers.
